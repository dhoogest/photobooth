These python scripts work together and in conjunction with linux programs gphoto2 and feh to provide a photobooth-like setup. Functions include: 

+ Tethering a digital camera via USB
+ Moving photos to local storage
+ Displaying the photo fullscreen
+ Deleting the files from camera storage

It's only been tested with ubuntu linux 12.04, gphoto2 2.4.11, feh 2.2 and a Nikon D3000, and is a bit janky at that.
